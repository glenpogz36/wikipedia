                <p>The <strong>history</strong> of the penny of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, the period in which the House of Hanover reigned, saw its transformation from a small silver coin to a larger bronze piece. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse. During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation. Beginning in 1787, the chronic shortage of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including ones valued at one penny. In 1797 Matthew Boulton gained a government contract and struck millions of pennies. The copper penny continued to be issued until 1860, when they were replaced by lighter bronze coins; the "Bun penny", named for the hairstyle of Queen Victoria on it, was issued from then until 1894. The final years of her reign saw the "Old head" pennies, coined from 1895 until her death in 1901</p>
